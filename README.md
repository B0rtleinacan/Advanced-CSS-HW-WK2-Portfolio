# Advanced-CSS-HW-WK2-Portfolio

Created a starting portolio landing page. 

## Description

In this project I have created the landing stage of my portfolio. I had to figure out a way to display content via images while also adding a description of myself and a picture. There were/are issues with this page, as I have not gotten fully comfortable using CSS or have the full idea down on how to apply it in my own way. I have learned a lot and how to formulate things, but I have a long way to go.
